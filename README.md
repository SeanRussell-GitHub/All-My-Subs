  *This application is something  I thought would be useful in daily life; real-world necessity made me think of keeping track of not just subscriptions, but after deployment it became obvious this could also be useful as an all around bill tracker.*


#
## User Story

Having a running total of all the subscriptions to various websites and applications is essential for balancing budgets, forseeing the financial future, and just to keep track of apps we're paying for but not using anymore.

#

## Progression

This project started on paper, as a class project to create an application whose only purpose is to track and tally monthly subscriptions.
Using mostly HTML and Javascript I was able to get the gist of my idea functioning properly, but keeping the project serverless was going to require another layer. Netlify and Mongodb satisfied this requirement.
After learning how to create and deploy a serverless app on Netlify from an essential tutorial (*linked below) I was able to add and deploy my project to Netlify and save static information to the cloud with MongoDB.

#
This project would not have been possible without this essential tutorial from [Ben Hong](https://github.com/bencodezen): [*"Up and Running with Serverless Functions"*](https://explorers.netlify.com/learn/up-and-running-with-serverless-functions). Many thanks, and I recommend his tutorials to anyone interrested in furthering their knowledge.
